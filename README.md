####Apple Stock Price Prediction
##Overview
This project is aimed at predicting Apple's stock price (AAPL) using historical data with a machine learning model based on LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural networks. The model uses the Yahoo Finance API to fetch historical stock data and predict future trends based on the past stock prices.

##Features
Data Fetching: Downloads Apple's historical stock data from Yahoo Finance based on user-defined date ranges.
Data Preprocessing: Scales the stock data using MinMaxScaler to prepare it for LSTM.
Modeling: Utilizes an LSTM model to predict future stock prices based on past data.
Visualization: Plots both actual and predicted stock prices for comparison.
Technologies Used
Python: Programming language used for the project.
LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory): A type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) used for time series forecasting.
yfinance: A Python library to download financial data from Yahoo Finance.
TensorFlow/Keras: For building and training the LSTM model.
Matplotlib: For data visualization (plotting actual vs predicted prices).
Scikit-learn: For data preprocessing (scaling and splitting data).
Installation
